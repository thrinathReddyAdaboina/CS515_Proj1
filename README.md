I have worked around 60-80 hours on the project (the most efficient time overall it might be more than that :p)

I have tested my code by taking appropriate map examples from the canvas examples and tested in gradescrope at last.

I have resolved all the bugs for the baseline code and I think I wrote the extensions bug free as well.

It was mostly related to the whitespaces i.e. the way I was printing the o/p and the expected o/p from gradescope.

I have written 4 extensions they are 
1. drop
2. winning and loosing
3. directions
4. help

1. Drop: "drop [item]": drops the specified item from the inventory into the current room.
"boss open": opens the boss room if the player has the required items (a magic wand and a sword).

2. Winning and losing: "boss open": opens the boss room if the player has the required items (a magic wand and a sword) in the inventory. If they don't have both of them then the player is going to loose the game.
3. directions: Itâ€™s common to be able to use an exit as a verb. That is, simply typing east instead of go east.
4. help:  shows the list of commands.
